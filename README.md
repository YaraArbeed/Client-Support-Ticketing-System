 I worked on a comprehensive application called TicketHero, which is a client support ticketing system.
The project aimed to streamline client support processes by allowing clients to submit support tickets for various company products.
It also enabled the support team to efficiently handle and resolve tickets while providing managers with the ability to assign and approve ticket statuses and track them.
TicketHero offers companies the opportunity to deliver exceptional support experiences.
