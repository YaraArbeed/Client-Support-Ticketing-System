I contributed to the back-end development of TicketHero, a comprehensive client support ticketing system built on the .NET framework. This application streamlines support processes by allowing clients to submit tickets for various company products. The support team can efficiently manage and resolve these tickets, while managers can assign, approve, and track ticket statuses. By providing a centralized platform for support interactions, TicketHero empowers companies to deliver exceptional customer experiences
